# Brush Up - Art Critique Platform

## Overview

Brush Up (formerly Art Critique) is a Django-powered web application that provides a comprehensive platform for art professionals to share, critique, and engage with creative works through innovative digital interactions. The platform features user authentication via Google OAuth, artwork uploads with S3 storage integration, a critique system with reactions, and a karma point system for community contributions.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Django 5.0.2 with Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- **Server**: Gunicorn WSGI server optimized for production deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- **Authentication**: Django Allauth with Google OAuth integration
- **API**: RESTful API with comprehensive serializers for frontend integration

### Frontend Architecture
- **Templates**: Django templates with Bootstrap 5.3.6 for responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Styling**: Bootstrap Icons and custom CSS for enhanced user experience
- **Interactive Elements**: Dynamic artwork galleries, critique systems, and user profiles

### HTTP-Only Configuration
The application is specifically configured to run in HTTP-only mode to ensure compatibility with Replit's load balancer and deployment environment. SSL termination is handled at the infrastructure level.

### Artwork Management
- File upload handling with support for multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, TIFF)
- S3 integration for scalable media storage
- Image processing and display optimization
- **Advanced Version Management System**:
  - Preserves image history during version creation
  - Safe version restoration with auto-backup of current state
  - Drag-and-drop version comparison interface

## Data Flow

### User Registration and Authentication
1. Users register via Google OAuth or standard Django authentication
2. Profile creation with karma initialization
3. Session management and permission handling

### Artwork Upload Process
1. User uploads artwork through Django forms
2. Files are processed and stored in S3 bucket
3. Metadata is saved to PostgreSQL database
4. Karma points are awarded for contributions

### Critique and Interaction Flow
1. Users browse artwork gallery with advanced filtering
2. Critiques are submitted and processed through API endpoints
3. Reactions are tracked and karma is calculated
4. Real-time updates to reaction counts and user profiles

### API Data Exchange
1. Frontend makes requests to Django REST API endpoints
2. Serializers handle data transformation and validation
3. Database queries are optimized for performance
4. Responses include computed fields like reaction counts

## Recent Changes

### June 17, 2025 - Comprehensive Version History System Enhancement âœ“
- **Fixed save current state API**: Resolved 400 error by adding `force_create` parameter to bypass change detection
- **Implemented version deletion**: Users can now delete versions with safety checks to prevent deleting the only version
- **Enhanced thumbnail refresh**: New version uploads immediately update thumbnails without requiring page refresh
- **Added restoration snapshots**: Version restoration now creates automatic snapshots of current state before switching
- **Critique-version associations**: Critiques are now linked to specific artwork versions, eliminating shared critique counts
- **Fixed z-index overlap**: Version history card no longer interferes with main navigation dropdown
- **Fixed deletion endpoints**: Resolved 405 error for version deletion and 404 error for critique reply deletion
- **Enhanced user feedback control**: Users can now delete their own replies regardless of engagement levels

### June 14, 2025 - Version Management System Fixes
- **Fixed critical version creation bug**: Versions now properly preserve old images instead of overwriting them
- **Improved version switching**: Changed "restore" to "set as current" - no unnecessary version creation
- **Enhanced version integrity**: All version operations now maintain proper image history
- **Cleaner user experience**: Version switching is now intuitive and doesn't create version clutter

### Technical Details
#### June 17, 2025 Updates
- Added `artwork_version` foreign key to Critique model with proper migration
- Enhanced version creation API with `force_create` parameter for saving current state
- Implemented comprehensive version deletion with artwork ownership and safety validations
- Added real-time thumbnail updates using cache-busting timestamps
