# User Profile API Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive Profile API for the Art Critique application that allows users to:
1. Retrieve their own profile information
2. Update their profile details including both Profile model fields and User model fields
3. Ensure proper permission restrictions (users can only access their own profiles unless they are staff)

## Implementation Details

### Models

We're using the existing Profile model which extends the User model:

```python
class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='profile')
    bio = models.TextField(max_length=500, blank=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    birth_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    profile_picture = models.URLField(max_length=1000, blank=True)
    website = models.URLField(max_length=200, blank=True)
```

### Serializers

We've created two specialized serializers:

1. **ProfileSerializer** - For retrieving profile information:
   - Includes user details (username, email)
   - Read-only fields for user protection
   - Used for GET requests

2. **ProfileUpdateSerializer** - For updating profile information:
   - Handles both Profile and User model fields
   - Custom update method to handle nested data
   - Used for PUT/PATCH requests

### ViewSet and Endpoints

We've enhanced the ProfileViewSet with:

1. **Permission controls**:
   - Users can only access their own profiles
   - Staff users can access all profiles

2. **Custom endpoints**:
   - `/api/profiles/me/` - GET current user's profile
   - `/api/profiles/update_me/` - PUT/PATCH to update current user's profile
   - `/api/profiles/` - List all profiles (staff only)
   - `/api/profiles/{id}/` - Get specific profile (staff or owner only)

3. **Custom serializer selection**:
   - Uses different serializers for different actions

## Testing and Verification

We've tested the API and confirmed:

1. Profile retrieval works correctly
2. Profile updates correctly modify both Profile and User model fields
3. Authentication and permission checks are enforced properly

## API Documentation

We've created detailed documentation in API_PROFILE.md that includes:

1. Endpoint descriptions
2. Request/response examples
3. Authentication requirements
4. Error handling information

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements for the future:
1. Add profile analytics (e.g., user activity metrics, karma)
2. Implement social features (e.g., follow/unfollow users)
3. Add profile picture upload functionality
4. Implement user roles and permissions
