This error sequence is very telling. Here's what's going wrong and how to fix it:

---

## üîç Error Breakdown

### 1. **`api/artworks/34/versions/reorder/ ‚Üí 500`**

This is the **backend endpoint** where you're POSTing the new version order.

A **500 error** means:

> The view (likely Django) is crashing on the server ‚Äî not a routing problem (yet).

---

### 2. **`SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'`**

This tells us the JavaScript was expecting a JSON response, but instead got an **HTML error page**. That HTML starts with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>...
```

So, your fetch is doing:

```js
fetch('/api/artworks/34/versions/reorder/', {...})
  .then(response => response.json())  // ‚Üê fails here
```

But since the response isn't JSON (it's HTML), you get:

```js
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
```

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

### ‚úÖ 1. **Confirm Your Backend URL Pattern Exists**

Check `urls.py` and ensure you have a pattern like:

```python
# in urls.py
path('api/artworks/<int:artwork_id>/versions/reorder/', reorder_versions, name='reorder_versions'),
```

If it‚Äôs missing, you‚Äôll get 404s or 500s depending on middleware behavior.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Check the Django View for Exceptions**

Your view function should look something like:

```python
@require_POST
@csrf_exempt  # (or use proper CSRF token via JS)
def reorder_versions(request, artwork_id):
    try:
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        new_order = data.get("version_order")  # expecting a list
        # Your logic to reorder here...
        return JsonResponse({"status": "ok"})
    except Exception as e:
        return JsonResponse({"error": str(e)}, status=500)
```

Log or print exceptions inside the `except` block to reveal what‚Äôs crashing.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Check Your JavaScript Request**

Make sure you're sending valid JSON and headers:

```js
fetch(`/api/artworks/${artworkId}/versions/reorder/`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-CSRFToken": getCookie("csrftoken")
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    version_order: versionIds  // example: [3, 1, 2]
  })
})
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Temporarily Inspect the Actual HTML Response**

To debug, insert this:

```js
fetch(url, ...)
  .then(response => response.text())  // <‚Äî temporarily use text()
  .then(data => console.log("HTML error page?", data));
```

If you see a Django error trace ‚Äî you've found the real problem.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Double-Check CSRF**

If you're not exempting the view and didn't send a valid CSRF token, Django will return a **403 page wrapped in HTML**, which still causes the same JSON parse error.

## üß™ Want Help Debugging the View?

If you share the view code for `/versions/reorder/`, I can pinpoint the problem exactly. But based on your error:

* You‚Äôre hitting the correct route (`POST /api/artworks/34/versions/reorder/`)
* But your view is throwing an exception and returning an HTML error page
* That HTML breaks your `.json()` expectation in JavaScript
