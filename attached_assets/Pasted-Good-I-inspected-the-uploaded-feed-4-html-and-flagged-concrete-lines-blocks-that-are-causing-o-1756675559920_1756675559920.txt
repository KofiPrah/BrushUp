Good — I inspected the uploaded feed (4).html and flagged concrete lines / blocks that are causing or are likely to cause the dial problems and future instability. You asked for risks/problems only (no fixes), so below are the issues I found with file citations so you can point the devs straight at the code.

Key problems / risky lines (no fixes)

Multiple / duplicate setupEmotionSafeScoring implementations

There are at least two different setupEmotionSafeScoring definitions in the codebase. This creates ambiguity about which version runs and invites regressions when one is edited but the other is not.

Selector mismatch / early exit when expected elements aren’t found

The function explicitly logs and returns when .score-btn elements are not found in the active framework — meaning the whole dial setup is skipped if the DOM structure differs from expectations. That exact diagnostic and early return is present in the file. This matches the console symptom of “Setting up 0 score buttons”.

The code also captures diagnostics and prints activeFramework.innerHTML.substring(0,200) when it fails — useful for debugging but indicates the code assumes specific markup and will break if the DOM shape changes.

Race conditions: code assumes elements exist and manipulates .style without guaranteed presence

There are many direct .style/transform manipulations (e.g. indicator rotation via style.setProperty / style.transform). If those elements are null (not yet in DOM) it leads to the Cannot read properties of null (reading 'style') error you saw. These inline style manipulations are sprinkled across the file.

There is a waitForScoringElements helper that polls for DOM readiness, but multiple places still assume immediate availability — mixed approaches = inconsistent behavior.

Inconsistent element-selection strategies (IDs vs data-attributes vs closest-scoped lookup)

Some code uses button.closest('.score-dial') and scoped findScoringElements(parentDial, target) while other sections fall back to document.getElementById(${target}-score). When markup switched to data-* or data-criterion attributes, these mixed selectors will break or return nothing. You can see both approaches present. This explains “elements exist but selectors return none.”

Idempotence checks / initialization flags can prevent re-initialization when desired

The code checks activeFramework._scoringInitialized and returns early if set. If the UI re-renders or the markup changes and that flag remains true, setup will be skipped and the dials won’t re-bind. This is a fragile stateful pattern.

Conflicting styling approaches: classes vs inline styles for color & state

The codebase toggles both CSS classes (e.g. low-score / medium-score / high-score and excellent / positive / challenging) and applies inline style changes for rotation / color in different places. Mixing class-based theming and inline styles creates scope for visual mismatch (colors not appearing, classes overridden, unexpected precedence).

Button re-binding strategy may remove important attributes / break references

One implementation clones buttons to remove listeners (const newButton = button.cloneNode(true); button.parentNode.replaceChild(newButton, button);) — cloning can drop attached runtime properties or break pointer-equality used elsewhere (and can reintroduce dataset issues). This can cause data-action/data-target mismatches or lost handlers.

Diagnostic logs reporting missing description / hidden inputs

Several logs show No hidden input found for ${target} and Could not find description or input for which mean the code expects sibling elements with names like -score, -desc, etc. If those elements are missing or renamed the visual & textual parts of the dial (score number, description color) won’t update.

Different implementations for drawing the dial arcs / segments exist

There’s an SVG arc creation routine in another file chunk that may or may not be the version actually used. Multiple implementations of arc/dial drawing increase the risk of inconsistent appearance across different builds.

Large / repeated console logging and dumping innerHTML in error paths

Diagnostic logging prints innerHTML substrings and lots of console output. In production or under heavy re-renders this can be noisy and hide the real failure, and it can be used as a crutch instead of robust presence checks.
