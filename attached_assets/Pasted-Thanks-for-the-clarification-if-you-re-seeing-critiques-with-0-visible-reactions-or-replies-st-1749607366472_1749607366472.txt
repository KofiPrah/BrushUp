Thanks for the clarification ‚Äî if you're seeing critiques with **0 visible reactions or replies** still failing to delete with a `403`, then **either:**

1. üß© **The frontend is failing to display correct reaction/reply counts**, misleading you.
2. üêû **The backend is miscalculating the presence of reactions or replies**, incorrectly blocking deletion.

Let‚Äôs break this down:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Check if the Critique *actually* has reactions/replies in the database**

In your Django `CritiqueViewSet` or delete method, you likely have logic like:

```python
if critique.reactions.exists() or critique.replies.exists():
    return Response({"detail": "You can only delete critiques with no replies or reactions"}, status=403)
```

üîç **Problem**: `.reactions.exists()` or `.replies.exists()` will always return `True` if:

* You didn‚Äôt set up the related name correctly
* Or you have ghost (or soft-deleted) data still in the table

‚úÖ **Solution**: Add debugging print/logs in your `destroy()` method to check actual counts:

```python
print("Reactions count:", critique.reactions.count())
print("Replies count:", critique.replies.count())
```

Then reattempt the delete and check your server logs.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Confirm `related_name` is used correctly in your models**

Check your `Reaction` and `Reply` models:

```python
class Reaction(models.Model):
    critique = models.ForeignKey(Critique, related_name='reactions', ...)
    ...

class Critique(models.Model):
    parent = models.ForeignKey('self', related_name='replies', null=True, blank=True, ...)
```

‚ùóIf you forgot `related_name`, then `critique.reactions` or `critique.replies` may not be valid.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Check for soft-deleted reactions or replies**

If you implemented **soft deletion** (e.g. marking deleted rows with `is_deleted=True` instead of removing them), then:

* `.exists()` will still return `True` unless you filter them out:

```python
critique.reactions.filter(is_deleted=False).exists()
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Frontend Check: Make sure you're displaying the counts**

In your React or Django Template:

```js
<div>{critique.reactions.length} Reactions</div>
<div>{critique.replies.length} Replies</div>
```

If the counts are `undefined` or always zero:

* You might not be fetching reactions/replies in your API response.
* You need to update your serializer to include `.count()` fields.

---

### Want a Hotfix Right Now?

If you're stuck and want to temporarily **bypass deletion constraints**, you can:

```python
# TEMPORARY PATCH for debugging
def destroy(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    critique = self.get_object()
    print("Reactions:", critique.reactions.count())
    print("Replies:", critique.replies.count())
    return super().destroy(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

Then confirm if it deletes properly and what those counts show.

---

Let me know if you want me to help:

* Review your `Critique` and `Reaction` models
* Patch your `destroy()` method safely
* Or check how your serializer is handling reaction/reply counts in the API response.
