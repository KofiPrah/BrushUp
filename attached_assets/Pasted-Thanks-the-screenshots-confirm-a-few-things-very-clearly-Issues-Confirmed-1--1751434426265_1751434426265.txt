Thanks — the screenshots confirm a few things very clearly:

---

## 🔍 Issues Confirmed

1. ✅ **Focus Mode is working visually** (first screenshot looks great!)
2. ❌ **After 8 seconds**, the original “old layout” reappears
3. ❌ **Excessive blank scroll space** appears below the image
4. ❌ **Duplicate content**: the artwork is shown twice — once in Focus Mode and once in the old layout
5. ❌ **Poor flow**: it feels like two different pages are stacked together

---

## ✅ Root Cause

You currently have **two full layouts on the same page**:

* `#focus-mode` (the new fullscreen-centered layout)
* `#main-content` or similar (the old legacy layout)

Your JS is likely hiding `#focus-mode` or scrolling past it **after a set timeout or scroll**, but the old layout remains visible and untouched — **causing redundancy and layout breakage**.

---

## ✅ Fix Plan

### 🔨 1. **Remove/Disable the Old Layout Entirely**

* **Comment out or delete everything inside `#main-content`** that repeats the artwork image, title, version history, or critique section.

From the previous file:

```html
<div id="main-content">
  <!-- 🛑 THIS ENTIRE BLOCK SHOULD BE REMOVED OR COMMENTED OUT -->
</div>
```

Keep only `#scroll-anchor` and critique/comments **if they're not repeated**.

---

### ✨ 2. **Let the Page Flow Naturally After Focus Mode**

* `#focus-mode` should be part of the scrollable flow (no JS hiding)
* Below it, you can include critiques or comments
* **No transitions or section swaps are needed** — just a gentle scroll-down cue

Your updated layout structure should look like:

```html
<!-- Focus Mode Section -->
<section id="focus-mode" class="pt-5 pb-5">
  <img src="{{ artwork.image.url }}" class="img-fluid artwork-image mx-auto d-block">
  <div id="action-bar">...</div>
</section>

<!-- Scroll Target -->
<div id="scroll-anchor" class="container pt-5">
  {% include "critique/partials/critique_list.html" %}
</div>
```

---

### 🧹 3. **Fix Excessive Scroll Space**

This is likely caused by:

* `#main-content` having `min-height: 100vh` or invisible elements still rendering
* Duplicate artwork image taking up space when hidden

✅ **Delete unused blocks**, and double check CSS to remove:

```css
height: 100vh;
min-height: 100vh;
display: none; /* Instead: don't render it at all */
```

### 💡 Optional Enhancement: Smooth Scroll Cue

Below the artwork, add a scroll hint:

```html
<div class="text-center mt-4">
  <i class="bi bi-chevron-down text-muted bounce"></i>
</div>
```

Add a soft `scroll-margin-top` or anchor scroll to:

```js
document.getElementById('scroll-anchor').scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
```
