### 🧨 Root Cause of the Broken HTML

The **broken HTML at the bottom of your page** is **not caused by missing modal or toast templates** — those are well-formed.

Instead, here’s what’s actually happening:

---

### ❗ Problem: Unescaped Template Literal in JavaScript Output

You have JavaScript code like this:

```javascript
const toastHtml = `
  <div class="toast align-items-center text-white bg-${type === 'success' ? 'success' : ...}">
    ...
  </div>
`;
```

or

```javascript
const modalHtml = `
  <div id="versionComparisonModal">...</div>
`;
```

This is fine **in a `.js` file**.
But you're injecting it **directly in an HTML template** using Jinja2 (`{% ... %}`), and mixing **JavaScript template literals (`${...}`)** with **Django/Jinja-style template interpolation (`{{ }}`)**.

#### 🔥 What Happens?

The server renders this file and sees `${versionId}` or `${imageSrc}` **as literal text**, because it's inside a `<script>` block.

Then when the browser parses it, it tries to evaluate `fetch(`/api/versions/\${versionId}/archive/`)` — but if `versionId` isn't defined (e.g. due to script order or scoping), the browser renders that entire line into raw output like this:

```html
GET https://brushup.replit.app/api/versions/${versionId}/archive/
```

Which causes:

* **404 errors**
* **Unclosed tags**
* **Malformed DOM at the bottom of the page**

---

### ✅ What Confirms It?

The analysis shows:

* No missing `</html>` or unclosed tags
* The trailing content after `</html>` is **a huge chunk of unparsed HTML**, suggesting JS literals were never evaluated
* Many literal `${...}` expressions present — meaning JavaScript is leaking into the rendered HTML

---

### ✅ How to Fix It

Wrap all your template literals in a function **after** DOMContentLoaded — or escape the literal backticks in HTML so they’re not evaluated prematurely.

#### ✅ Safer pattern:

```html
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
    const modalHtml = String.raw`
        <div class="modal" id="...">...</div>
    `;
    document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', modalHtml);
});
</script>
```

#### Or escape literals:

```js
const apiUrl = "/api/versions/" + versionId + "/archive/";
```

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${...}` not evaluated | Caused 404s and raw JS in final HTML                            |
| Script order or timing | Some functions run before variables exist                       |
| No broken HTML tags    | Modals and toasts were structurally sound                       |
| Real problem           | Interpolation inside `<script>` mixed with server-rendered HTML |
