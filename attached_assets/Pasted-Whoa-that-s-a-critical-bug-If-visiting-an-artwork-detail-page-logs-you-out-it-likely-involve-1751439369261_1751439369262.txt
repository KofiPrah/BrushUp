Whoa ‚Äî that‚Äôs a critical bug. If **visiting an artwork detail page logs you out**, it likely involves one of these backend or session-level issues in Django.

---

## üîç Root Cause Possibilities

### 1. **CSRF Token Mismatch or Missing**

If the page includes a form (`{% csrf_token %}`), but the token isn‚Äôt properly rendered (e.g., inside a script or broken block), Django may invalidate the session.

### 2. **Media or Static File URLs Require Auth**

If something like:

```html
<img src="{{ user.profile.avatar.url }}">
```

resolves to a protected media route (e.g., `/media/avatars/...`), and the file storage is not configured to allow anonymous access, Django may:

* redirect to login
* or throw a `403` or `302` redirect that breaks the page load

### 3. **Custom Middleware or View Logic Logs You Out**

If the `ArtWorkDetailView` checks session state or user cookies and fails validation, it could forcibly redirect to login.

### 4. **Browser Infinite Redirect Loop**

If Django tries to load something via AJAX or `<img>` that causes a redirect to login ‚Äî and it happens multiple times ‚Äî some browsers automatically clear session cookies.

## ‚úÖ What to Do Right Now

### üîé 1. Check for a broken avatar URL

In your `artwork_detail.html`:

```html
<img src="{{ critique.author.avatar.url }}" onerror="this.src='/static/img/default-avatar.png'" ...>
```

If `avatar.url` points to something that requires login ‚Äî it could break the page load.

**Solution:**

* Use `{% if critique.author.avatar %}` check
* Or ensure `/media/` is properly served and public

---

### üîé 2. View HTML source and network requests

Open browser dev tools:

* Go to the **Network** tab
* Reload `/artworks/35/`
* Look for any **302 redirects to `/accounts/login`**
* Look at cookies ‚Äî does the `sessionid` disappear?

---

### üîé 3. Confirm Login Requirements on View

In your `views.py`, check:

```python
class ArtWorkDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, DetailView):
    ...
```

If you're using `LoginRequiredMixin`, and `MEDIA_URL` or AJAX isn‚Äôt handled right, the view could silently redirect or fail.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Avatar/media requires auth | Serve `/media/` via `django.views.static.serve` in `urls.py` during development           |
| Avatar missing             | Add `onerror`, default image fallback                                                     |
| CSRF/token issue           | Wrap every form with `{% csrf_token %}` and load with `{% csrf_token %}` block tag active |
| Session resets on error    | Make sure no invalid cookies/headers are sent by the frontend                             |

## Want Help Diagnosing This?

If you share:

* `urls.py` handling of `/media/`
* the view function (`ArtWorkDetailView`)
* and the full `<img>` or `<form>` markup

‚Ä¶I can help you isolate this fast.

Would you like me to generate a new `artwork_detail.html` file with all previous fixes *and* this media/avatar protection handled?
