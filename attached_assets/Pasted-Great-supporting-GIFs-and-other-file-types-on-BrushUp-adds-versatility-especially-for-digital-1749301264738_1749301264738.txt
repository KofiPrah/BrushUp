Great ‚Äî supporting GIFs and other file types on **BrushUp** adds versatility, especially for digital artists, animators, or mixed media creators. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **file types you might want to allow**, **recommended handling**, and **limits you should enforce** to keep performance manageable:

### ‚úÖ **Recommended File Types to Support**

| File Type          | Use Case                                                   | Notes                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **JPEG / JPG**     | Standard artwork and photography                           | Lossy but widely supported                                         |
| **PNG**            | Artwork with transparency, crisp line art                  | Larger file sizes; good for digital illustrations                  |
| **GIF**            | Animated or looping artwork                                | Limit frame count or file size to prevent performance issues       |
| **WEBP**           | Alternative to PNG/JPEG; supports animation & transparency | Good compression, but not supported in older browsers              |
| **SVG**            | Vector art and logos                                       | Useful for scalable vector uploads, but beware of embedded scripts |
| **MP4**            | Optional, for time-lapse or animation previews             | Only if you allow short video uploads in future                    |
| **ZIP** (optional) | Upload multiple files (e.g., sketch + reference)           | Use case-specific; not necessary for MVP                           |

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Recommended Image Upload Rules**

| Rule                                | Suggested Limit              | Reason                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Max file size (JPEG/PNG/GIF)**    | 10‚Äì20 MB                     | Balance quality and server load                        |
| **Max dimensions**                  | 5000√ó5000 px                 | Avoid massive uploads; resize if exceeded              |
| **GIF max frame count or duration** | \~10 seconds or 100 frames   | Prevent heavy animated content from affecting UX       |
| **SVG security**                    | Sanitize before accepting    | Prevent script injection via embedded SVG code         |
| **Thumbnails**                      | Generate for all image types | Ensures gallery loads quickly (esp. for GIFs and PNGs) |

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Tips

* **Preview display**: For GIFs, allow motion on detail view only (pause in feed view to save bandwidth).
* **Storage handling**: Use AWS S3 or Firebase Storage with MIME-type filters to accept allowed formats.
* **Conversion**: Consider converting uploads to WebP for gallery thumbnails to save space and bandwidth.
* **Validation**: Check MIME type and enforce allowed extensions (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`, etc.).

Would you like me to help you:

1. Draft validation logic for Django?
2. Define a table for supported MIME types?
3. Plan how to generate thumbnails and previews per file type?

Let me know what direction you‚Äôd like to take next.
