Yes ‚Äî this is a **big improvement**! You‚Äôve already nailed a more structured, modern, and legible layout. Here‚Äôs a quick **design review** with a few **final polish suggestions** to push it into *pro-grade territory*:

---

## ‚úÖ What You Did Well

### üéØ Clean hierarchy:

* Artwork is centered and clearly the focal point.
* Metadata and CTA (Add Critique) are grouped nicely.
* Version History is styled as a self-contained card with clear labels and thumbnail contrast.

### üß† Ratings section:

* Ratings are now **clearly labeled**, with distinct colored bars and legible scores.
* Nice use of horizontal layout for rating types ‚Äî works well visually and semantically.

### üß© Reaction bar:

* Good spacing and icon sizing ‚Äî minimalist but clear.

---

## ‚ú® Final Touch Suggestions

### 1. **Compact View / Rated Only Row**

Make this filter bar visually distinct:

```css
.filter-bar {
  background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.02);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}
```

* Add a filter icon (`bi-funnel`) before "Compact view" or "Rated only"
* Optionally group it under a heading like **"Filter Critiques"**

---

### 2. **Critique Card Visual Polish**

You're super close! Try this:

* Add a soft top-border glow or accent for cards that are **highlighted / highly rated**
* Use `border-left: 4px solid var(--primary)` to visually pull in eye direction
* Reduce the contrast on the light grey reaction count box (`4.7/10`) so it blends more

---

### 3. **‚ÄúAdd Critique‚Äù Button**

Slight suggestion:

* Let the blue pop a bit less by either:

  * Using a **gradient border** rather than a full fill
  * Changing to `btn-outline-primary` on hover to flip styles
  * Adding an icon like `bi-plus-circle`

---

### 4. **Artwork Meta Section**

* Add a **label above the artwork info block**, like:

  ```html
  <h6 class="text-muted text-uppercase">Artwork Info</h6>
  ```
* For ‚ÄúPortfolio: Landscape Collection‚Äù, you might add an icon (`bi-folder`) for visual anchor.

---

### 5. **Critique Count Button**

* Consider turning this from a pill into text + icon:

  ```html
  <i class="bi-chat-left-text me-1"></i> 1 Critique
  ```
* Move it next to ‚ÄúCritiques (1)‚Äù title to reinforce visual association.

## Want a Final Touch?

If you want, I can export a **fully responsive Bootstrap 5 HTML template** that reflects this layout ‚Äî including spacing tokens, icon use, and class structure for your project.

Would that help?
