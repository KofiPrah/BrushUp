Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs your **recap and build checklist** for implementing **Focus Mode as the default** on your BrushUp artwork detail page.

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

> Make the **artwork the centerpiece**, delaying UI elements and collapsing everything else until the user *intentionally engages* (scroll, hover, or wait).

---

## üß± Layout Architecture

### 1. **Hero Section (Focus Mode Container)**

* Full viewport height (`height: 100vh`)
* Artwork centered (max height 90‚Äì100%)
* Background: solid dark or gradient pulled from artwork
* Hidden UI overlays (to be revealed after delay)

### 2. **Delayed UI Elements**

* Favorite button ‚ù§Ô∏è
* Version info chip (e.g., ‚Äúv2 (Current)‚Äù)
* Scroll cue (down arrow or "See Critiques")
* Optional: action dropdown / ‚ÄúAdd Critique‚Äù button

> ‚è± Use `setTimeout` (\~5 seconds) to fade these in

### 3. **Scroll Anchor**

* Scrolling down reveals:

  * Critiques (collapsed by default)
  * Comments (optional)
  * Version History (minimized chip or off-canvas)

## üß∞ Components to Build

| Component           | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#focus-mode`       | Fullscreen hero section with artwork                           |
| `#delayed-ui`       | Bottom-floating UI (favorite, version chip) ‚Äî hidden initially |
| `#scroll-anchor`    | Wrapper for everything below artwork (critiques, etc.)         |
| `#critique-section` | Starts collapsed; expands on scroll or user interaction        |
| `#version-history`  | Optionally hidden/minimized until user clicks or scrolls       |
| `scroll-indicator`  | Animates gently to suggest scroll interaction                  |

## üé® CSS/JS Needs

### CSS

* `vh-100` container
* `opacity-0` ‚Üí `opacity-100` transition for delayed UI
* `overflow: hidden` on body initially (prevent scroll)
* Animations:

  * Fade-in
  * Optional slight zoom or parallax on artwork

### JS

* `setTimeout` for delayed UI
* `wheel` or `scroll` listener to reveal main content and unlock scroll
* `IntersectionObserver` (optional) to fade in critique blocks on entry
* Event toggles for collapsible UI

## üîÑ User Flow Summary

1. **Page Loads**

   * Artwork fills the screen
   * No controls visible yet

2. **After 5s**

   * Buttons/icons fade in
   * Scroll cue appears

3. **On Scroll or Click**

   * Page unlocks
   * Critique section slides in
   * Additional UI expands (version history, actions, etc.)

4. **Below-the-fold**

   * Structured critiques (collapsed initially)
   * Comments
   * Add Critique button
   * Version history summary

## üß™ Optional Enhancements

* Ambient background blur
* Fullscreen zoom on artwork click
* Keyboard support (e.g., `Esc` to collapse critiques, `‚Üì` to scroll to feedback)
* Transitioned feedback when returning from full-view to focus mode

Would you like me to generate a **starter template** now (HTML + Bootstrap + JS) with all of this pre-wired and commented for integration into your Django template?
