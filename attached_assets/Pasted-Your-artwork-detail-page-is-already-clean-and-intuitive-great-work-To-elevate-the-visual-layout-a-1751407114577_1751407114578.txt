Your artwork detail page is already clean and intuitive—great work! To elevate the **visual layout and clarity**, here are specific suggestions broken down by section:

---

## 🎨 1. **Main Artwork Area (Top Center)**

### ✅ **Make the Artwork More Prominent**

* Add a subtle shadow or light border to the image to separate it from the background:

  ```css
  .artwork-image {
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255,255,255,0.1);
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
  ```

### ✅ **Add Spacing Between Metadata**

* Increase vertical spacing between the artwork title, creation date, artist, and portfolio link. Right now it's a bit tight.

* Example with Bootstrap:

  ```html
  <div class="mb-2">Created: ...</div>
  <div class="mb-2">Artist: ...</div>
  ```

## 🧭 2. **Right Sidebar (Version History)**

### ✅ **Tighten Version History Layout**

* Add visual balance with more **consistent padding** and spacing between items.

* Consider grouping elements like this:

  * **Header:** "Version History" + toggle in a single line
  * **Thumbnail Stack:** Use `.mb-2` between thumbnails
  * **"Compare Versions"**: Align it to bottom or center to reduce floating look

### ✅ **Visual Enhancements**

* Use lighter hover effects or subtle outlines on version thumbnails.
* Consider a label like “v2 (Current)” inside the thumbnail rather than outside, reducing width strain.

## 🗣 3. **Critique Section**

### ✅ **Improve Visual Hierarchy**

* Right now everything is in a dark rectangle — try:

  * **Card-style layout** per critique with light borders or a subtle background
  * Give `Ratings` a bold title bar or icon
  * Separate the “...” comment from the rating block visually (e.g., a light divider or spacing)

### ✅ **Color Coding for Ratings**

* You're already using color! Nice. Make it **consistent and intuitive**:

  * e.g., green for 7–10, yellow 4–6, red 1–3
  * Consider small icons next to rating names (like a brush for “Technique” or spark for “Originality”)

### ✅ **Improve Reaction Row**

* Add tooltips on icons ("Helpful", "Inspiring", etc.)
* Use color fills or hover animations to enhance interactivity
* Spread the icons out with `gap-3` or `justify-content-around`

## 🧩 4. **Actions & Buttons**

### ✅ **Clarify the 'Actions' Dropdown**

* Add a dropdown caret (`▼`) if not already present
* Use icons inside the dropdown to aid scanning

### ✅ **Elevate “Add Critique” Button**

* Give it more visual weight:

  * Slight increase in padding or font-size
  * Maybe place it right under the title or under the artwork with emphasis
  * Optional: use a "+" icon on the button

## 🧼 5. **Minor UX Polish**

* **Compact View Toggle:** Align left and closer to “Critiques (1)” label
* **Sort Dropdown:** Add a label like “Sort by” next to the dropdown for clarity
* **Profile Link:** Add hover underline on artist name or avatar to indicate it's clickable

---

## 🧠 Bonus: If You Want To Get Fancy

* Consider **scroll sync** or a sticky sidebar for Version History when scrolling critiques
* Add **tabs** for separating structured critique vs comments if the section grows long
* Display **average rating summary** (like 6.3/10 overall) near the title or under the artwork as quick insight
