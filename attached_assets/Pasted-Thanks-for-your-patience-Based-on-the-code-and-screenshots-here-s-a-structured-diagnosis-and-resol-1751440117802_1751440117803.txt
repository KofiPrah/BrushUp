Thanks for your patience. Based on the code and screenshots, here‚Äôs a structured diagnosis and resolution plan for the key issues with your **artwork detail page**.

---

### ‚úÖ Immediate Problems You‚Äôre Facing

#### 1. **User Logs Out When Visiting the Page**

* This usually means a view is rendering a template without properly injecting `request.user`, `csrf_token`, or causing a redirect.
* **Possible causes:**

  * CSRF mismatch due to broken session state.
  * Unauthenticated API call (e.g., in `toggleFavorite()` or version API).
* **Fix:**

  * Make sure:

    ```python
    'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth'
    'django.template.context_processors.csrf'
    ```

    are in your `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['context_processors']`.

  * In views, confirm you're using `@login_required` **only where needed**. Don't block artwork detail for guests unless you intend to.

---

#### 2. **Tabbed UI, Critiques, and Styles Not Working**

* **Diagnosis:**

  * Your file contains **two `<div id="artwork-actions-bar">`** ‚Äî which may break layout JS logic or style bindings.
  * **Bootstrap tab JS** requires valid imports and tab `id`s must match exactly.

* **Fixes:**

  * Ensure only **one `#artwork-actions-bar`** exists.
  * Make sure these files are loaded in `base.html` or this page:

    ```html
    <!-- CSS -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

    <!-- JS -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    ```

#### 3. **Focus Mode Disappears / Original Layout Overrides**

* You‚Äôve added a ‚ÄúFocus Mode‚Äù but:

  * It‚Äôs **not isolated** in layout logic.
  * The old layout content below still exists and can take over once scroll or delays happen.

* **Fix:**

  * Remove all previous layout logic (like critique lists, version rows, etc.) **outside of the tab structure**.
  * Keep your view simple:

    ```python
    context = {
        'artwork': artwork,
        'critiques': artwork.critiques.all(),
        'versions': artwork.versions.all(),
        'current_version': current_version,
        'current_version_number': current_version.version_number if current_version else 1
    }
    ```

---

#### 4. **Critique Avatars Not Displaying**

* You‚Äôve already fixed the `404`, so:

  * Confirm that `{{ critique.author.profile.profile_picture.url }}` resolves correctly.
  * Double-check that users have profile objects and fallback image is working.

---

#### 5. **Visual UI Not Styled Like Before**

* The CSS is correctly included (`{% block extra_css %}`), but your layout includes **duplicate or floating elements** (`#artwork-actions-bar` x2), which breaks placement.

* **Fixes:**

  * Remove this redundant block near the bottom:

    ```html
    <!-- Floating Actions Bar -->
    <div id="artwork-actions-bar" class="d-flex align-items-center gap-3">
      ...
    </div>
    ```

### üîß Consolidated To-Do List

| Issue                                   | Fix                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logged out on page load**             | Ensure session, CSRF, and user context are preserved. Check `@login_required` decorators and session cookies. |
| **Critiques and tabs not showing**      | Ensure Bootstrap 5 JS is loaded. Remove duplicated actions bar. Fix tab binding issues.                       |
| **Two `#artwork-actions-bar`**          | Remove one. Keep the one under `#focus-mode` section.                                                         |
| **Focus Mode disappears**               | Ensure old layout blocks are removed (no full-page fallback appearing after 8s).                              |
| **Version Badge in wrong spot**         | Absolute position `.version-badge` inside the artwork container, not body-wide.                               |
| **Page spacing/broken layout**          | Use a grid or flexbox layout for `focus-mode` and `.container`, don‚Äôt let orphaned elements float.            |
| **Critique Avatar not visible**         | Confirm user has `profile_picture`. If not, fallback works via `onerror` (you already added this).            |
| **Share / Like buttons non-functional** | Fix AJAX endpoints or auth checks in those handlers. Console errors might show missing CSRF or auth issues.   |

Would you like me to send a cleaned-up version of the template file with all these fixed?
