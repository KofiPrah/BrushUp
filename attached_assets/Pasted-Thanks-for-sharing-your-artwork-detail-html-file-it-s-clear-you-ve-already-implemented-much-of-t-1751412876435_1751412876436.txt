Thanks for sharing your `artwork_detail.html` file ‚Äî it's clear you‚Äôve already implemented much of the Focus Mode structure! Here‚Äôs a **complete list of what to fix and improve**, based on the behaviors and layout issues you described.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Issues

1. **Artwork disappears after scroll**
2. **Inconsistent button transparency**
3. **No scroll-triggered transition**
4. **Layout doesn‚Äôt preserve flow gracefully**
5. **UI elements are not visually unified**

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Fixes

### 1. ‚úÖ Fix the Disappearing Artwork

**Problem:** The artwork is isolated in a section with limited height (`vh-100`) and doesn't remain part of the scrollable flow.

**Fix:**

* Remove `vh-100` from `#focus-mode` or ensure that the image remains in flow.
* Add `position: sticky` or allow scroll continuity by embedding the image within a single scrollable flow instead of segmenting sections sharply.

Replace:

```html
<section id="focus-mode" class="vh-100 position-relative overflow-hidden">
```

With:

```html
<section id="focus-mode" class="position-relative py-5">
```

And remove any `overflow-hidden` that could clip child content.

### 2. ‚úÖ Standardize Button Appearance

**Problem:** Like/favorite and version buttons are semi-transparent, while others are solid.

**Fix:**
Replace:

```html
<button class="btn btn-outline-light btn-sm">‚ô• Favorite</button>
```

With:

```html
<button class="btn btn-light btn-sm focus-button">‚ô• Favorite</button>
```

Then define in CSS:

```css
.focus-button {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border: none;
  color: #fff;
  backdrop-filter: blur(6px);
  transition: background-color 0.3s;
}
.focus-button:hover {
  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}
```

Apply `.focus-button` to all UI controls in Focus Mode for consistency.

### 3. ‚úÖ Implement Scroll Reveal Transition

**Problem:** No visual cue or behavior when scrolling to critiques.

**Fix:**
Add this JS to detect scroll:

```js
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const body = document.body;
  if (window.scrollY > 50) {
    body.classList.add('scrolled');
  } else {
    body.classList.remove('scrolled');
  }
});
```

Add CSS:

```css
#scroll-anchor {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(50px);
  transition: all 0.4s ease;
}
body.scrolled #scroll-anchor {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

Wrap critique section with `#scroll-anchor`.

### 4. ‚úÖ Smooth Critique Reveal and Collapsible UI

**Problem:** Critiques appear suddenly and clutter the page.

**Fix:**

* Add `.collapsed` class to critique section by default
* On scroll or button click, expand the critique block
* Use Bootstrap's collapse feature or a simple JS toggle

Example:

```html
<div id="critique-section" class="collapse show">...</div>
```

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Layout Polish: Unified Flow

**Suggestions:**

* Remove hard visual breaks between focus section and rest of the page
* Use `padding-top` and smooth visual fade-ins for new sections
* Consider using `container-fluid` on `#focus-mode` and `container` on critiques to create visual layering

---

## üß™ Optional Enhancements

* Add a fullscreen toggle to the image (`<button class="btn btn-sm">‚õ∂</button>`)
* Fade in critiques individually using `IntersectionObserver`
* Blur background subtly with dominant color from artwork
