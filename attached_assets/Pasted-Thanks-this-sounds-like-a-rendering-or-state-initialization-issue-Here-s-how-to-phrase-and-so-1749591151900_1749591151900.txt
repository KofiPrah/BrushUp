Thanks — this sounds like a **rendering or state initialization issue**. Here's how to phrase and solve it:

---

### ✅ Problem Description (Dev-Friendly)

> When the comparison modal first opens, only the **base layer image** is displayed. The **overlay image** is missing (not rendered or set to display: none), so the **opacity slider appears non-functional**. The overlay only appears **after clicking "Swap"**, which is unintuitive.
>
> **Expected Behavior:**
> The **overlay image should be visible** immediately on entering the modal, regardless of whether “Swap” has been clicked. Opacity control should affect it right away.

---

### ✅ Implementation Fixes

#### 1. **Ensure Both Images Are Mounted**

In your React render logic, check that the overlay image isn't conditionally skipped:

```jsx
{baseImage && (
  <img src={baseImage} className="base-layer" />
)}

{overlayImage && (
  <img
    src={overlayImage}
    className="overlay-layer"
    style={{ opacity: overlayOpacity }}
  />
)}
```

#### 2. **Avoid Premature Null State**

Make sure your overlay image state is initialized properly before modal opens:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  if (isModalOpen) {
    setOverlayImage(preloadedOverlay); // ← Set this in modal entry logic
  }
}, [isModalOpen]);
```

If it’s undefined on first render, the image won’t mount — leading to the slider doing nothing.

#### 3. **Debug Visibility with CSS**

Check if the image is present but invisible (e.g., `display: none`, `opacity: 0`, or `z-index` issues).

Temporarily apply:

```css
.overlay-layer {
  border: 1px solid red;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

### ✅ Summary of Fixes

| Step | Action                                                            |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Ensure overlay image state is set **before or on modal open**     |
| 2.   | Render overlay image by default, regardless of swap state         |
| 3.   | Bind opacity slider to a real image layer, not a null placeholder |
| 4.   | Use dev tools or temp borders to debug visibility                 |
