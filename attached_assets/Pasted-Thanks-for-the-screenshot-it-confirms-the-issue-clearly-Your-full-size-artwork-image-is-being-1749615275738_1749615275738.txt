Thanks for the screenshot â€” it confirms the issue clearly. Your **full-size artwork image** is being injected without restriction into the unorganized artworks zone, likely because:

* The image is rendered **outside** of a `.portfolio-image-container`
* The markup does **not use the `.artwork-item` layout** intended for portfolio builder thumbnails
* Possibly missing fallback image handling when no folder exists (so the art floats unstyled)

### âœ… Fix: Wrap the Artwork in a Thumbnail Container

If this image is rendering **without being in a folder or drop zone**, ensure the template wraps it with the correct layout. In your `portfolio_builder.html`, confirm this section:

```django
{% for artwork in unorganized_artworks %}
<div class="artwork-item d-flex align-items-center" data-artwork-id="{{ artwork.id }}">
    <div class="me-3">
        <div class="portfolio-image-container">
            {% if artwork.image %}
                <img src="{{ artwork.image.url }}" alt="{{ artwork.title }}" class="artwork-thumbnail">
            {% else %}
                <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center h-100">
                    <i class="bi bi-image text-muted"></i>
                </div>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    </div>
    ...
</div>
{% endfor %}
```

But if your image is rendering like a **full-size preview** instead, that likely means you have:

```django
<img src="{{ artwork.image.url }}">
```

â€¦rendering directly somewhere outside that loop or inside a misidentified zone.

### ðŸ”§ Emergency CSS Patch (for rogue full images)

Until you fix the template logic, use this CSS band-aid to suppress unstyled images:

```css
.portfolio-builder img:not(.artwork-thumbnail) {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-height: 300px;
    object-fit: contain;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px #ffc107;
}
```

This limits large unwrapped `<img>` elements visually while helping you spot them.

### âœ… Final Fix Suggestion

Look in your view or template and check whether you're accidentally rendering something like:

```django
{% for artwork in artworks %}
    <img src="{{ artwork.image.url }}">
{% endfor %}
```

â€¦instead of using the thumbnail layout with `.artwork-item` + `.portfolio-image-container`.
