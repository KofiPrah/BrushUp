Thanks for the updated file — I reviewed `artwork_detail (4).html` and can now give you **specific actions** to fix Focus Mode and restore your ❤️ **like button design**.

## 🔧 1. FIX: **Artwork Disappears on Scroll**

The issue is that you're still using **two separate layout structures**:

* `#focus-mode` (`vh-100`) for initial display
* Then `#main-content` with a second `<img>` block inside

📛 This causes the image to flash, disappear, or jump.

### ✅ Fix Strategy: Use **only one layout**, not both

### ✅ Do this:

**Delete or comment out** the second image block inside `#main-content` (lines 938–942):

```html
<!-- REMOVE THIS DUPLICATE BLOCK -->
{% if current_version and current_version.image %}
    <img src="{{ current_version.image.url }}" class="card-img-top img-fluid artwork-image" ...>
{% endif %}
```

You're already rendering the image correctly in `#focus-mode` (line 65). That’s the **only place it should be shown**.

### 🧠 Why?

The artwork shouldn't appear twice — it should be one continuous experience. Let `#scroll-anchor` just introduce critiques/comments *below* it without switching layouts.

## 💙 2. RESTORE: Heart Button (Like/Favorite)

You're right to want to preserve your custom ❤️ button! The AI agent swapped it for Bootstrap defaults, but your original idea had charm.

Here’s how to bring it back *with style*:

### ✅ Option 1: Your Custom Heart (Restored Cleanly)

```html
<button class="btn btn-like" aria-label="Favorite">
  ♥
</button>
```

```css
.btn-like {
  background: none;
  border: none;
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: white;
  transition: color 0.3s ease;
}
.btn-like:hover,
.btn-like.liked {
  color: #ff5e78;
}
```

* Add `.liked` class via JS or server-side logic to show filled/active state.

### ✅ Option 2: Use Bootstrap Icon

```html
<button class="btn btn-dark btn-heart" aria-label="Favorite">
  <i class="bi bi-heart-fill"></i>
</button>
```

With style:

```css
.btn-heart {
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  color: white;
  background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.05);
  border: none;
}
.btn-heart:hover,
.btn-heart.active {
  color: #ff4d6d;
}
```
