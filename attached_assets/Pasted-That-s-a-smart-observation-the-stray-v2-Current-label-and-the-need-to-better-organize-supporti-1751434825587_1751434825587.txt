That’s a smart observation — the stray “v2 (Current)” label and the need to better organize supporting info are signs that **Focus Mode needs a well-defined "companion panel" layout**, not just hidden UI that fades in randomly.

Let’s restructure this experience properly.

---

## 🔧 Issue: Floating Label (v2 Current)

This is likely being rendered in the same container as the artwork but **absolutely positioned without alignment rules**, so it drifts into awkward places.

---

## ✅ Fix This Specific Bug

### Check your template:

You likely have something like:

```html
<span class="badge bg-purple position-absolute">v2 (Current)</span>
```

But no wrapper or positioning context.

### Fix it:

Wrap the label in a properly positioned container:

```html
<div class="position-absolute top-0 end-0 mt-3 me-3 z-1">
  <span class="badge bg-purple">v2 (Current)</span>
</div>
```

And make sure the parent container (`#focus-mode`) has `position: relative`.

## 🧠 But Bigger Picture: You’re Ready for a Layout Split

You're absolutely right — **the critique/comments/info/version UI needs a second layout phase**, separate from the fullscreen image experience.

---

## ✨ Ideal UX Structure

### Phase 1: Focus Mode

* Full-screen image
* Minimal action bar (like you've built)
* 5–7 second intro or click-to-continue

### Phase 2: **Split View or Docked Panel Mode**

No more scrolling required — just a **structured layout** like this:

```
+---------------------------+-----------------------+
|                           |                       |
|      ARTWORK (static)     |      SIDE PANEL       |
|                           |  ┌───────────────┐    |
|                           |  | Info: title    |    |
|                           |  | Artist         |    |
|                           |  | Created        |    |
|                           |  └───────────────┘    |
|                           |  ┌───────────────┐    |
|                           |  | Critiques      |    |
|                           |  | (scrollable)   |    |
|                           |  └───────────────┘    |
|                           |  ┌───────────────┐    |
|                           |  | Version History|   |
|                           |  └───────────────┘    |
+---------------------------+-----------------------+
```

## 🛠 Implementation Option 1: 2-Column Flexbox

### HTML Layout

```html
<div class="d-flex flex-lg-row flex-column min-vh-100">
  <!-- Artwork -->
  <div class="flex-grow-1 bg-dark d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center">
    <img src="{{ artwork.image.url }}" class="img-fluid" />
  </div>

  <!-- Side Panel -->
  <aside class="bg-body px-4 py-5" style="width: 480px; overflow-y: auto;">
    <h4>{{ artwork.title }}</h4>
    <p>By {{ artist.username }}</p>
    <p class="text-muted">Created {{ artwork.created }}</p>

    {% include "critique/partials/critique_list.html" %}
    {% include "version_history.html" %}
  </aside>
</div>
```

### CSS:

```css
aside {
  border-left: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.05);
}
```

## 🧰 Bonus: Add a "View Fullscreen" Toggle

Let users switch between:

* **Immersive Mode** (full image, no panel)
* **Critique Mode** (split layout or side drawer)

---

## ✅ TL;DR

| Problem                | Fix                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Floating version label | Wrap in `position-absolute` container inside a `position-relative` block           |
| Too much scroll        | Introduce a **2-panel layout** that avoids full-page vertical scroll               |
| Scattered UI           | Group artwork info, critiques, and version history into a unified **docked panel** |
| Better UX              | Let user transition from **Focus Mode** to **Panel Mode** after visual engagement  |

Would you like me to code a working HTML+CSS layout for this split mode structure that you can drop into your Django template?
