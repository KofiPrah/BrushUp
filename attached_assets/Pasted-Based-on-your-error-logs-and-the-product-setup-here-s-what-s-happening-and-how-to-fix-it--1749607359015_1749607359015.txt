Based on your error logs and the product setup, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening and how to fix it:

### üî¥ **Issue 1: Reaction Failing (400 Bad Request)**

**Errors:**

```
POST /api/critiques/16/react/ 400 (Bad Request)
Error toggling reaction: Error: Failed to toggle reaction
```

**Likely Causes:**

1. The request payload might be missing or incorrectly formatted.
2. The backend expects a `reaction_type` (e.g., `"HELPFUL"`, `"INSPIRING"`, `"DETAILED"`) in the body of the POST request.

**Fix:**
Make sure your JavaScript function that sends the request includes the correct payload and headers:

```js
await axios.post(`/api/critiques/${critiqueId}/react/`, {
  reaction_type: "HELPFUL" // or "INSPIRING", "DETAILED"
}, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

### üî¥ **Issue 2: Deletion Failing (403 Forbidden)**

**Errors:**

```
DELETE /api/critiques/16/ 403 (Forbidden)
Error deleting critique: Error: You can only delete critiques with no replies or reactions
```

**Behavior is expected if:**

* The critique has **at least one reaction or reply**, based on your logic: *‚ÄúUsers can delete their own critique only if it has no reactions or replies‚Äù*.

**Fix or UX Suggestion:**

* You should **catch this error in the frontend** and show a user-friendly message:

```js
if (error.response.status === 403) {
  showToast("This critique has feedback from others and cannot be deleted. You can edit it or request to hide it.");
}
```

### ‚úÖ **Checklist for Debugging and Fixes**

| Area       | What to Check                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Reaction | `POST` request body must include `reaction_type`.                                                 |
| ‚úÖ Delete   | Server-side permission is working correctly. Don't change unless logic needs to be updated.       |
| üîÑ UX      | Add frontend error handling + messages for these common failures.                                 |
| üß™ Backend | Confirm `@action` in Django ViewSet for `react` correctly handles input and enforces constraints. |

Let me know if you want help rewriting the frontend functions or the backend view handling `/react/`.
