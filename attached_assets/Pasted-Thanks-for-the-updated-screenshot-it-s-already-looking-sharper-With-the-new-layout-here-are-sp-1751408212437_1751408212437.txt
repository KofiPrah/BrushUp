Thanks for the updated screenshot — it’s already looking sharper! With the new layout, here are **specific refinements** you can apply to further elevate clarity, hierarchy, and user flow:

---

## 🎯 TOP SECTION: Artwork & Metadata

### ✅ **Suggestions:**

* **Tighten the "Artwork Info Block":**

  * Add a soft vertical rule or subtle border between the artwork and the sidebar.
  * Reduce the whitespace between “Created” and “Artist” rows — use `.mb-1` instead of `.mb-3`.

* **Call-to-Action Area (Add Critique):**

  * Group the ❤️ like + critique button into one visually unified block with consistent vertical alignment.
  * Consider making “Add Critique” full-width on smaller screens using `w-100 w-md-auto`.

### 💡 Option: Use a sticky right sidebar

If you’re using Bootstrap, you could try:

```css
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  .version-history {
    position: sticky;
    top: 80px;
  }
}
```

## 🖼️ VERSION HISTORY SIDEBAR

### ✅ **Suggestions:**

* Add padding inside each thumbnail container (`.p-1` or `.p-2`)
* Add **hover state**:

  ```css
  .version-thumb:hover {
    outline: 2px solid #6c63ff;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  ```
* “Compare Versions” toggle could benefit from:

  * More vertical breathing room (`mt-3`)
  * A horizontal divider above it

## 🧠 CRITIQUE SECTION

This is shaping up nicely — here are some micro-adjustments:

### ✅ **Critique Container**

* Consider giving the whole card a subtle elevation:

  ```css
  .critique-card {
    box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
    border-radius: 6px;
  }
  ```

### ✅ **Ratings Row:**

* Give each rating bar a little label or icon for immediate comprehension:

  * 🖌️ Technique
  * 💡 Originality
  * 🧭 Composition

You could also use:

```html
<small class="text-uppercase fw-bold text-muted">Ratings</small>
<hr class="my-2">
```

### ✅ **Reaction Bar at Bottom:**

* Improve button spacing with `gap-3` or `justify-content-between`
* Add hover feedback (e.g. background glow or scale-up animation)
* Tooltip on hover:

  ```html
  <button data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Helpful" ...>
  ```

---

## ✨ VISUAL POLISH (Global)

* **Use consistent shadows or borders** across cards (e.g., critique card, version history, etc.)
* Align “Compact View” and “Sort By” in one line — right now they feel slightly disjointed
* Add subtle divider lines (`<hr class="text-muted my-3">`) between major page zones for scannability

## Final Thought

You're **very close** to a fully professional-grade detail page. These refinements are about polishing what’s already structurally sound. Would you like me to generate a clean HTML/CSS mockup for this layout that reflects all the suggestions?
