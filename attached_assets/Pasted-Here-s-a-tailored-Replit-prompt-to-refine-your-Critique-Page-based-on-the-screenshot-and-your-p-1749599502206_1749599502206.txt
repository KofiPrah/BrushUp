### 🛠️ Replit Prompt: Refine Critique Page UI & Functionality

**Goal**: Polish the critique display for clarity, visual hierarchy, and engagement using structured data and community signals.

---

**🔧 Tasks:**

1. **UI Enhancements**

   * Style critiques in **cards** with proper spacing, border radius, and background (respecting light/dark mode).
   * Visually separate:

     * Author name + timestamp (top, small font)
     * Slider ratings (horizontal bars with category labels: Technique, Originality, Composition)
     * Written feedback (body text)
     * Reactions (bottom row with badge icons: Helpful, Inspiring, Detailed)

2. **Structured Critique Display**

   * Convert numerical ratings (1–10) into **labeled bars** or **stars** with consistent style.
   * If any rating is 9–10 or 1–2, append a tooltip or tag like:

     * ✅ "Outstanding" (for high)
     * ⚠️ "Needs improvement" (for low)

3. **Engagement & Reactions**

   * Add buttons for "Helpful", "Inspiring", "Detailed" (one selectable per user)
   * Show counts and highlight if current user reacted
   * Reaction state should be togglable with AJAX for snappy UI

4. **Threaded Replies**

   * Display threaded replies indented under each critique
   * Include "Reply" link → opens a textarea inline
   * Submit reply via AJAX (no page reload)

5. **Optional Badges**

   * If the critique author has badges (e.g. "Expert Eye"), show beside their name

---

**✨ Extras (Optional Stretch)**

* Show a mini **karma score** next to critic name
* Add “Sort by” dropdown (e.g., Most Helpful, Newest)
* Make critiques collapsible (expand/hide body)

---

**🎯 Replit Context**

* Django backend
* Bootstrap 5
* AJAX interactivity via vanilla JS
* Theme support (light/dark)

Let me know if you want this scaffolded into HTML + JS + Django template snippets.
