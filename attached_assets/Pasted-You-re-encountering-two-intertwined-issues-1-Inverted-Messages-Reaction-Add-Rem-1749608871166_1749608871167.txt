You're encountering two intertwined issues:

---

## üîÅ **1. Inverted Messages: Reaction Add/Remove Notifications Are Swapped**

### ‚úÖ Problem

You're displaying:

* **‚ÄúSuccessfully removed‚Äù** when `created: true` (meaning the reaction was just added)
* **‚ÄúSuccessfully added‚Äù** when `created: false` (meaning the reaction was just removed)

### ‚úÖ Fix in Your JS

Wherever you're handling the reaction toggle response (like in `toggleReaction()`):

```js
if (response.data.created) {
  showToast("Reaction added!");
} else {
  showToast("Reaction removed!");
}
```

> üîÅ Your logic is reversed right now ‚Äî just swap the success message to match the `created` flag.

## üß© **2. Critique Reactions Are Not Accurately Cleared**

### ‚úÖ Problem

Even after toggling off all visible reactions, the backend still blocks deletion because:

* `reaction_count` in `get_engagement_summary()` shows leftover counts (`1`, `2`, etc.)
* You're receiving:

  ```json
  "details": "Critique has 2 reaction(s)"
  ```

### ‚úÖ Diagnosis

This suggests **there are still reactions in the database**, even after unclicking them.

### üîé Confirm This on Backend:

Inside `destroy()` or a debug API view, log:

```python
print("All reactions for critique:", critique.reactions.all().values('user__username', 'reaction_type'))
print("Filtered (excluding self):", critique.reactions.exclude(user=critique.author).values('user__username', 'reaction_type'))
```

---

## ‚úÖ Fix: Ensure Reactions Are Actually Deleted on Toggle-Off

In your **reaction toggle view (likely a `@action` on your `CritiqueViewSet`)**, you probably have logic like:

```python
reaction, created = Reaction.objects.get_or_create(...)
if not created:
    reaction.delete()
```

Make sure:

* That `reaction.delete()` actually runs on toggle-off
* You‚Äôre calling `exclude(user=self.author)` in your `has_engagement()` logic (you are ‚Äî this is good!)

If this logic is **silent-failing**, then reactions remain in the DB, falsely blocking deletion.

---

## üßº Optional DB Cleanup for Dev/Test

If you‚Äôve been testing a lot and now have ghost reactions stuck, you can manually clear them:

```python
# From shell
from critique.models import Reaction
Reaction.objects.all().delete()
```

(Only do this in a **dev** or **testing** environment!)

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist for You

| Area                    | Action                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Reaction messages     | Swap add/remove based on `created` flag                       |
| ‚úÖ Backend deletion      | Log actual reaction users/types at delete time                |
| ‚úÖ Reaction toggle logic | Confirm `reaction.delete()` is running on second click        |
| ‚úÖ Debug cleanup         | Optionally remove stuck reactions if testing artifacts remain |

Let me know if you'd like help writing a debug endpoint or inspecting the toggle logic!
