You want to allow an artist (the artwork author) to hide a critique that someone posted on their artwork.

You're getting this error:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
POST to /artworks/29/ ‚Üí 405 Method Not Allowed
This means you're sending the request to the artwork detail endpoint, but hiding a critique is not an action that belongs on the artwork detail route. It's an action on a critique, not an artwork.

‚úÖ The Right Approach
Instead of posting to:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /artworks/29/
You should be posting to something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/critiques/<critique_id>/hide/
This would be a custom action on the Critique model or viewset.

üîß Backend Fix (Django REST Framework)
If you're using DRF and have a CritiqueViewSet, you can define a custom action like this:

python
Copy
Edit
from rest_framework.decorators import action
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status, permissions

class CritiqueViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Critique.objects.all()
    serializer_class = CritiqueSerializer

    @action(detail=True, methods=['post'], permission_classes=[permissions.IsAuthenticated])
    def hide(self, request, pk=None):
        critique = self.get_object()

        # Check if the request user is the author of the artwork being critiqued
        if critique.artwork.author != request.user:
            return Response({'detail': 'Not authorized.'}, status=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN)

        critique.is_hidden = True
        critique.save()
        return Response({'detail': 'Critique hidden.'}, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
And in your urls.py:

python
Copy
Edit
router.register(r'critiques', CritiqueViewSet)
Then from the frontend, send a POST request to:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/critiques/14/hide/
Payload can be empty unless you want to log a reason or timestamp.

üîÅ Recap
/artworks/29/ is not the right place to POST.

Make /api/critiques/<id>/hide/ accept POST via a custom action.

Validate that the current user owns the artwork.

Update the is_hidden field and return success.
