# Deployment Fixes Applied for Brush Up

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Port Configuration
- **Issue**: Application binding to port 5000 but deployment expects port 8080
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Created optimized `gunicorn.conf.py` with dynamic port binding: `bind = f"0.0.0.0:{os.environ.get('PORT', '8080')}"`
  - Updated `main.py` to properly export WSGI application as `app` for Gunicorn compatibility

### ✅ 2. Worker Count Optimization  
- **Issue**: Workers experiencing SIGKILL due to memory issues during startup
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Reduced worker count from 2 to 1 in `gunicorn.conf.py`
  - Added memory management: `max_requests = 1000, max_requests_jitter = 100`
  - Enabled `preload_app = True` for better memory usage

### ✅ 3. Health Check Endpoint Enhancement
- **Issue**: Health checks failing at root endpoint
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Enhanced `/health/` endpoint with robust JSON response
  - Added database connectivity testing
  - Returns proper HTTP status codes (200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy)
  - Includes service identification in response

### ✅ 4. Timeout Configuration
- **Issue**: Application timing out during startup
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Increased timeout to 120 seconds in `gunicorn.conf.py`
  - Added proper logging for startup monitoring
  - Enhanced error handling in `main.py`

### ✅ 5. WSGI Application Structure
- **Issue**: Incorrect module path causing import errors
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Updated `main.py` to properly setup Django and export WSGI app
  - Added comprehensive logging for deployment debugging
  - Set proper environment variables for production mode

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `gunicorn.conf.py` - Production Gunicorn configuration
- `deploy.py` - Deployment verification script
- `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `main.py` - Enhanced with logging and proper WSGI export
- `artcritique/urls.py` - Improved health check endpoint

## Deployment Command
The corrected deployment command should be:
```bash
gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py main:app
```

## Health Check Verification
- Endpoint: `/health/`
- Response: JSON with status, database connectivity, and service info
- Currently verified working on development port 5000

## Next Steps for User
Since I cannot directly edit the `.replit` file, you'll need to update the deployment configuration to:

1. **Update deployment run command** to use the optimized configuration:
   ```
   run = ["sh", "-c", "gunicorn --config gunicorn.conf.py main:app"]
   ```

2. **Update workflow commands** to use the same pattern for consistency

3. **Verify health check path** is set to `/health/`

The application is now optimized for deployment with proper memory management, timeout handling, and health monitoring.
