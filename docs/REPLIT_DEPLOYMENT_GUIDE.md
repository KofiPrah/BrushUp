# Replit Deployment Guide for Art Critique

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Art Critique Django application on Replit's Autoscale platform.

## Understanding Local Development vs. Deployment

There are two modes of operation for this application:

1. **Local Development** (with HTTPS):
   - Uses self-signed certificates stored in `certs/cert.pem` and `certs/key.pem`
   - Handles TLS termination in the application
   - Binds to port 5000

2. **Replit Deployment** (plain HTTP):
   - No SSL certificates needed (Replit handles TLS termination)
   - Uses the PORT environment variable set by Replit
   - Simple HTTP binding

## Deployment Configuration

To deploy this application on Replit Autoscale, you need to create a proper `.replit` configuration file:

```toml
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
run = [
  "sh", "-c",
  "gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8080} artcritique.wsgi:application"
]

[env]
REPLIT_HEALTHCHECK_PATH = "/api/health/"
SSL_ENABLED = "false"
```

## Important Notes

1. **Do not use SSL/TLS in the Gunicorn command**
   - Replit's load balancer already handles TLS termination, so your app should run over plain HTTP
   - Remove any `--certfile` and `--keyfile` parameters from your Gunicorn command

2. **Always bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`**
   - Replit Autoscale sets the `PORT` environment variable to a random high number
   - Your application must listen on that port to be accessible

3. **Add a health check endpoint**
   - The application already includes a health check endpoint at `/api/health/`
   - This is important for Replit to verify that your application is running correctly

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

If you encounter an `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR` when deploying:

1. **Verify local functionality**
   ```bash
   export PORT=8080  # Choose any free port
   python scripts/cli.py serve --protocol http   # Use the unified CLI
   ```

2. **Test the HTTP endpoint locally**
   ```bash
   curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health/
   ```

3. **Check your deployment logs**
   - After deploying, immediately click on the "Logs" button to see any startup errors

## Complete Deployment Process

1. Create the appropriate `.replit` file (as shown above)
2. Commit your changes
3. Click "Deploy â†’ Autoscale"
4. View the logs to ensure the application starts correctly
5. Once deployed, your app will be available under a `.replit.app` domain

## Database Considerations

- The application is configured to use the PostgreSQL database credentials from environment variables
- Make sure the production database is properly configured and accessible from the deployment environment
