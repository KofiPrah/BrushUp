# Authentication Progress Report

## Implemented Features

### Authentication API
- Added proper login endpoint to `/api/auth/login/` enabling users to authenticate with username/password
- Fixed permissions on the login endpoint by explicitly allowing unauthenticated users to access it
- Successfully tested complete authentication flow (login, session checking, logout)
- Created detailed API_AUTHENTICATION.md documentation for all authentication endpoints
- Verified that session management and CSRF protection work correctly

### API Documentation
Created comprehensive API documentation that covers:
- Authentication flow (CSRF token, login, session check, authenticated requests, logout)
- Detailed endpoint specifications with request/response formats
- Example usage with curl commands
- Implementation notes for frontend developers

### SSL Issue Resolution
- Identified SSL-related issues causing ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR
- Created alternative server scripts to run the application in HTTP mode:
  - `start_server_with_http.sh` - Runs the application without SSL certificates
  - Modified main.py to better handle SSL configuration

## Authentication Endpoints
All authentication endpoints are now fully functional:
- `/api/auth/csrf/` - Get a CSRF token for making authenticated requests
- `/api/auth/login/` - Log in with username and password
- `/api/auth/session/` - Check if the current session is authenticated
- `/api/auth/logout/` - Log out and invalidate the current session
- `/api/auth/user/` - Get the profile of the currently authenticated user

## Next Steps
1. Add user registration endpoint to allow new users to sign up
2. Implement password reset functionality
3. Add social authentication integration
4. Create frontend components that use these authentication endpoints
5. Add more comprehensive validation and error handling to the authentication process

## Notes for Replit Environment
For optimal deployment in the Replit environment:
- Use `bash start_server_with_http.sh` to start the server without SSL
- For Autoscale deployment, ensure the server binds to 0.0.0.0:$PORT with plain HTTP
- Set SSL_ENABLED=false environment variable to use HTTP mode
