# Verifying AWS S3 Media Access

This document explains how the AWS S3 media access has been configured and verified for the Art Critique application.

## Configuration Overview

The application has been configured to ensure images stored in AWS S3 are properly accessible to frontend applications:

1. **Public Read Access**: The S3 bucket is configured to allow public read access to media files
2. **Unsigned URLs**: Query string authentication is disabled for cleaner URLs
3. **CORS Configuration**: The S3 bucket has CORS settings that allow cross-origin requests
4. **Cache Headers**: Cache-Control headers are set for optimal performance

## Key Settings

The following settings have been added to `settings.py` to ensure proper image accessibility:

```python
# Disable signed URLs for public bucket access
AWS_QUERYSTRING_AUTH = False
    
# For security, verify your bucket has proper CORS settings
AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = 'public-read'
```

## End-to-End Verification

The image upload and access flow has been verified to work correctly:

1. When a user uploads an image through the API, the file is sent to AWS S3
2. The S3 URL is stored in the ArtWork model's `image` field
3. The API returns both the image path and the full S3 URL via `image_display_url`
4. Frontend applications can directly use this URL to display the image

## URL Examples

- **S3 Storage URL**: `https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/media/artworks/your_image.jpg`
- **URL in API Response**: The `image_display_url` field contains the full URL

## How Frontend Can Use These URLs

Frontend applications can directly use the URLs provided in API responses:

```javascript
// Example of displaying an image in a frontend application
const ArtworkDisplay = ({ artwork }) => {
  return (
    <div className="artwork-container">
      <h2>{artwork.title}</h2>
      <img 
        src={artwork.image_display_url} 
        alt={artwork.title} 
        className="artwork-image"
      />
      <p>{artwork.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Security Considerations

While the bucket is configured for public read access to simplify development, in a production environment you may want to consider:

1. Using CloudFront for caching and HTTPS
2. Implementing signed URLs for time-limited access to sensitive images
3. Employing bucket policies to restrict access by origin

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If images are not properly accessible, check:

1. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure the S3 bucket has proper CORS settings
2. **ACL Settings**: Verify files are set with public-read ACL
3. **Bucket Policy**: Check if the bucket policy allows public read access
4. **CloudFront Cache**: If using CloudFront, check if the cache needs invalidation

## Conclusion

The AWS S3 integration has been successfully configured with public read access. This ensures that when a new artwork is created via the API with an image, the image is properly stored on S3 and its URL is saved and accessible for frontend use.
